Calling Out Those Names Again

Jeon Tae-il, Park Jong-cheol, Lee Han-yeol... Just hearing their names brings a lump to my throat.

In times when making ends meet was a struggle, they gave their all for a better world. Thanks to them, we can now work in a slightly better environment.

Sometimes, when I complain about suffocating late-night work, their sacrifices come to mind. I should spend today with a grateful heart, striving to make the world a little better.

Does that sound like something an old-timer would say? Well, I can't help it. I guess I'm getting old. Heh heh.

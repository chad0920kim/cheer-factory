On my way home from work, I found myself in front of the beer fridge, like always.

Instead of my usual beer, I felt like trying something different today.

Carlsberg? It's the Danish Royal beer, right? I guess it feels kinda fancy, or maybe that's just me.

The moment I opened the can, a slightly bitter yet refreshing scent tickled my nose.

Well, I worked hard today. This is like a small reward for myself. Gotta keep going tomorrow!

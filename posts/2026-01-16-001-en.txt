I ended up taking a day off. My body was sending me signals, and I couldn't ignore them. I was starting to think I might really collapse from overwork. Every time I saw news about people dying from overwork, it didn't feel like someone else's problem. I'll be back after catching my breath. Everyone, let's take care of our health while working!

Okay, so today I'm gonna introduce you to a place with amazing vibes – it's a live cafe and bar! 
It's Friday night, but I can't drink... 😭 (tears)

"No-alcohol Friday night" is kinda sad, but I gotta heal with the atmosphere! The interior design is super artsy and I totally loved it.

The fact that they have live music performances is really attractive. Listening to music with a drink in the evening would be so stress-relieving! (But I'm not drinking...)
I definitely wanna visit again at night and have a drink next time! 🍻

If you're looking for a place with a good vibe in Myeongdong, I totally recommend this place! 
It's good for both lunch and dinner, so give it a try. 😉

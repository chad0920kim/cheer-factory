Hi everyone, especially those working in Myeongdong! I'm a 40-something office worker who lives for lunchtime. 

Today, I'm introducing a famous sundae soup restaurant in Myeongdong. I thought I was early, but there were already 4 teams waiting! Guess it's really a popular place. 

The menu is super simple: Regular sundae soup and Special! Doesn't that scream 맛집? And they're smart - they don't sell alcohol before 2 PM. So, if you're craving a daytime drink, come after 2! 

Finally, my sundae soup arrived! The hot broth is amazing. It's the perfect dish for a cold day. There's so much meat inside, it's really filling. The broth is rich, the sundae is chewy, and the taste is perfect. Can't find anything to complain about! 

I think the price was pretty good too. I remember the sundae soup being around 8,000 won. (Now 10,000 won) Considering Myeongdong prices, that's a steal! This is an honest review, paid for with my own money. 

If you're ever craving hot soup in Myeongdong, definitely give this place a try! You won't regret it.

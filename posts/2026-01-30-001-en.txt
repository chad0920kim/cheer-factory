Hey everyone! Myeongdong office worker here. I'm back with another delicious lunch adventure! Today I went to a really special place(?).

I bet you already know from the picture, right? It's McDonald's! 🤣 I think it might be the most popular McDonald's in the whole country. Since it's right in the middle of Myeongdong... ahem.

Today's order was the Bacon Tomato Deluxe Burger set!
I added coleslaw and also got an iced Americano.

The burger was sweet for my taste, the coleslaw was tangy, and the iced Americano... was a little small! LOL. But it tasted amazing because it was a free burger.

Honestly, you all know what McDonald's tastes like, but it's perfect for a quick and cheap lunch in Myeongdong! I should visit Myeongdong McDonald's once in a while. 😉

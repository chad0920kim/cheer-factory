Hey everyone! I'm an office worker in Myeongdong.

Today, during the holiday, I took a big step and went all the way from Myeongdong to Gwangcheon in Chungnam just to eat some Kalguksu (Korean knife-cut noodle soup). Whoosh!

To be honest, it's not like a super amazing restaurant that you absolutely MUST visit.

Um... it just tastes like a clean and simple Kalguksu?! That's pretty much it.
The broth is refreshing, but it's not something that's super impressive or anything.

Looking at the menu, they also sell Suyuk Gukbap (Pork Soup with Rice). It's 10,000 won! Kalguksu is 8,000 won!

I wonder if it was a bit too much to come all the way to Gwangcheon just for Kalguksu, but it was nice to get some fresh air.

In conclusion, don't have too high expectations, and visit when you're craving a clean and simple Kalguksu!

Personally, I recommend the Taean Seobu Market Kalguksu more. I'll post about that later. ~

From Myeongdong to Gwangcheon... hmmm... 🤔

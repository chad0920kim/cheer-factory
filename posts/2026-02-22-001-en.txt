RESTAURANT: 한우나주곰탕|경기도 안산시 상록구 사동 1476-6||1

Hi everyone, it's the Myeongdong Office Worker Food Explorers! Today, we visited a gomtang (beef bone soup) restaurant where you can warm up and boost your energy.

The place I'm introducing today is called 'Naju Gomtang'. They only have one menu item: gomtang! Isn't that like a rule for good restaurants? The single menu gives off the aura of a master... My expectations were soaring.

Actually, I was expecting clear Naju gomtang, but this place served a milky white broth. The meat also had some fat, so it had a slightly greasy, deep flavor. I thought people who prefer clear gomtang might have mixed feelings about it.

But don't worry! The kkakdugi (radish kimchi) juice completely gets rid of the greasiness. I recommend not adding it from the beginning, but adding it after eating about half. It was nice to be able to enjoy two different flavors.

The price is 12,000 won. Considering it's Hanwoo (Korean beef), it's a reasonable price, right? Considering Myeongdong prices, it's about average. It's a good place to visit when you want to warm up with a hot soup on a cold day!

While paying, I ran into a neighbor. She was getting takeout, so I guess it really is a good restaurant.

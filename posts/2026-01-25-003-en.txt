Apink is still performing? Wow, that's surprising! 

Seeing them on Open Concert right now, it's really them. 

I started reminiscing about the old days without even realizing it... guess I'm getting old. 

Time flies so fast, but it's amazing and even makes me feel thankful that someone is still the same as they were back then. 

Thanks to them, I had a nice trip down memory lane. Gotta live my life to the fullest today too!

Hey everyone, it's your Myeongdong office worker food explorer! Today, I'm gonna introduce you to my favorite lunch spot. It's a place I'm totally obsessed with... (drum roll please)... a Jjol-Gop-Soon restaurant! 

Whenever I'm trying to decide what to eat for lunch, I always end up here. I always order the Jjol-Gop-Soon. As you can see in the picture, the visuals are just... making my mouth water!

The charm of this place is the generous portions! It's a self-serve system where you can scoop as much rice as you want from a huge bowl. Plus, they even have an egg station! You all know you gotta cook the eggs carefully on low heat so they don't splatter or burn, right? That's a pro tip! We cooked 2 sunny-side up and 2 hard-boiled eggs per person, and ate them all up.

The chewy noodles are so good, and the soft tofu is amazing! And it has lots of 곱창 (gopchang - grilled intestines), which is a perfect combination. The red sauce might look really spicy, but it's actually not. It's so easy to eat! Even I, who can't handle spicy food very well, can enjoy it without a problem.

The price is reasonable, and the atmosphere is relaxed, so it's a great place to eat alone. How about trying the fantastic combination of chewy noodles, soft tofu, and savory 곱창 for lunch today? You won't regret it!

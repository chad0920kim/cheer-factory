Another day, another late night leaving the office. 
When will I ever get to leave on time? 
It's like the amount of work magically increases right before quitting time, right? You all know what I'm talking about!

I'm not the only one dealing with this, am I? Hang in there, everyone! 
Make sure to eat dinner, okay?

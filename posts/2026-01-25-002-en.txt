Why does the weekend go by so fast? 
Just thinking about Monday is already making me dizzy... I'm not the only one, right? 

But what can we do? Gotta have some chicken and beer. 
That's what keeps me going for another week. 

To everyone going to work tomorrow, let's all hang in there! 
Let's at least finish today happily.

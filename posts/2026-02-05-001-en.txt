I went to Myeongdong for lunch and was totally surprised. 

Guess what? They're opening a Hunan Province (China) local cuisine restaurant in a place that's under construction. 

Myeongdong is really something. 

You can find literally anything here. 

But... I wonder if Korean people will like it? It's none of my business, but I just got curious. Well, if it does well, that's great, and if it doesn't... oh well. That's life, right?

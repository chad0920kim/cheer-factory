Hey everyone, it's your friendly neighborhood food explorer from Myeongdong!

Today, I'm gonna share my experience at 'Bunggung Sundaeguk Ansan Main Branch,' which I always noticed on my way home from work.

To be honest, the name was a little hard to pronounce, so I hesitated at first. But my sister-in-law strongly recommended this place, saying it's a real gem. So, on the last morning of the holiday, I rushed over there. Sundaeguk for breakfast? It felt a bit heavy, but I was really looking forward to it because she said it's delicious!

OMG, there was a waiting line even in the morning! I guess it's a legit popular spot. Looking at the menu, the regular Sundaeguk is called 'Snow Flower Sundaeguk,' and the spicy one is 'Fire Flower Sundaeguk' - their naming sense is on point! I ordered the 'Herbal Siraegi Sundaeguk.'

Finally, the Siraegi Sundaeguk arrived! The meat was super tender, and the sundaeguk was so savory and delicious. Especially because of the siraegi (dried radish greens), the broth felt deeper and cleaner? You know it's a must to eat sundaeguk with salted shrimp, right? It's the perfect combo!

I ended up finishing the entire bowl, even the broth! LOL. It was so filling and tasty. Although it's far from Myeongdong, if you're ever in Ansan and craving a hot bowl of soup (because I live in Ansan), I totally recommend Bunggung Sundaeguk! Give it a try - you won't regret it!

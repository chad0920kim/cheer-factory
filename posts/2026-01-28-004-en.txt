On my way home from work, I opened the CU app like I always do... and saw the Carlsberg Liverpool glass package available for pre-order! I knew I had to buy it instantly. I've been a Liverpool fan (KOP) for over 10 years, so I can't resist stuff like this.

What's life all about anyway? Just a beer after work and enjoying my favorite team's merch. My wallet might be empty after payday, but my heart is full of magic! 

Sometimes, these small joys are what make going to work worthwhile. Long live fangirling! Long live Carlsberg! Let's go Liverpool, win the championship!

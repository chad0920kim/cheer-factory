On my way home from work, I opened the CU app like usual... and saw a pre-order for the Carlsberg Liverpool glass set! I knew I had to get it right away. I've been a Liverpool fan (KOP) for over 10 years, so I can't miss out on stuff like this.

What's life all about, right? A beer after work and looking at your favorite team's merch is a great way to recharge. My wallet might be empty, but my heart is full – it's like magic!

Sometimes, these small joys are what make working at a company bearable. Long live being a fan! Long live Carlsberg! Let's go Liverpool win the championship!

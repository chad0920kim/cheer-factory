On my way home from work, I habitually opened the CU app... and saw a pre-order for the Carlsberg Liverpool glass package! I knew I had to buy it right away. I've been a Kop (Liverpool fan) for over 10 years, and I just couldn't resist. 

What's life all about, right? Having a beer after work and looking at my favorite team's merchandise to cheer myself up. My paycheck might be empty, but my heart feels full of magic! 

Sometimes, these little joys are what make working at the company worthwhile. Long live fangirling! Long live Carlsberg! Let's go Liverpool for the win!

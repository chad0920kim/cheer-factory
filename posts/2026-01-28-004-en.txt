On my way home from work, I did my usual thing and opened the CU app... and saw the Carlsberg Liverpool glass package for pre-order! As soon as I saw it, I knew I had to buy it. I've been a KOP (Liverpool fan) for over 10 years, so I can't resist things like this.

What's life all about anyway? It's about having a beer after work and getting energized while looking at your favorite team's merch. My paycheck might disappear, but my heart feels full of magic!

Sometimes, these small moments of happiness are what make working at a company worthwhile. Long live fangirling! Long live Carlsberg! Let's go Liverpool, win the championship!

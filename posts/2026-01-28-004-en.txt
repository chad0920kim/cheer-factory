On my way home from work, I did my usual thing and opened the CU app... and bam! Carlsberg Liverpool glass package pre-order! As soon as I saw it, I knew I had to buy it. I've been a Liverpool fan (a Kopite!) for over 10 years, so there's no way I could pass this up.

What else is there to life, right? Chilling with a beer after work, looking at my favorite team's merch, that's what keeps me going. My bank account might be empty, but my heart is full! It's magic!

Sometimes, these little joys are the reason I go to work. Long live my hobby! Long live Carlsberg! Let's go Liverpool, win the league!

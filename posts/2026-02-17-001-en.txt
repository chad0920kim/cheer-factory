Weekend camping was tough, but so relaxing! 

Cleaning up all the gear and sweating a lot made me really crave something cold. 

Stopped by Starbucks on the way home and got an iced Americano, venti size! Just perfect.

Isn't this why we go camping? Time to go back to work after the holiday. Let's do our best!

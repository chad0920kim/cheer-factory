Weekend camping was tough, but also really relaxing.

After packing up all the gear and sweating like crazy, I was seriously craving something cold.

So, on the way home, I stopped by Starbucks and got a Venti iced Americano - perfect!

Isn't this why we go camping? Back to work after the holiday, let's do our best!

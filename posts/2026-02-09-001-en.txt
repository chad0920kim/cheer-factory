Hi Myeongdong office workers!
I'm a 40-something office worker who always looks forward to lunchtime.

Today, I'm going to introduce a hidden Korean food restaurant that only real locals in Myeongdong know about. I wanted to keep it a secret... but I decided to share it with you all! 😉

Today's star is! (Drum roll) A humble baekban place without even a sign.
Don't judge it by its appearance.
There aren't many places in Myeongdong where you can eat such a filling meal for this price. 👍

You can pretty much eat any common Korean dishes here.

As for the taste... honestly, it's a bit on the salty side.
But, it's not overly salty or spicy, so I enjoyed it. 
(Just so you know, I usually prefer my food a little bland!)

The atmosphere is totally like an old-school baekban restaurant.
Don't expect fancy interior design. 😅
But, the advantage is that you can have a hearty meal in a friendly atmosphere.

In conclusion! If you're looking for a Myeongdong local baekban place with great value, I highly recommend it!
Have a filling lunch here today and have a great afternoon! 💪

As a 40-something office worker who's always thinking about where to go for lunch, that's me! Today, I went to 'Dimdimsum' in Myeongdong, which is famous for its dim sum. Guess what? I got a 10% discount coupon! I couldn't miss this chance, so I rushed over there. 😎

Thanks to the coupon, I ordered some dishes that I usually find a bit pricey. This is what I call a small flex, right? 😆 Dimdimsum tastes almost exactly like the dim sum I had in Hong Kong, so it's perfect for when I'm missing Hong Kong. The atmosphere is clean and spacious, making it easy to have a comfortable lunch.

I ordered the Wonton Noodle Soup and Shrimp and Chives Dumplings! The Wonton Noodle Soup had a really refreshing broth and the noodles were so chewy, I slurped it all up. The Shrimp and Chives Dumplings were crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside - so delicious! But be careful, the freshly made dumplings are super hot. 🔥 I almost burned my mouth… 😅

The prices are a bit high, but the 10% discount made it much more affordable. I recommend Dimdimsum if you want to eat dim sum in Myeongdong! Especially when you have a discount coupon, definitely go. 🤩 It's near Myeongdong Station, so the location is great! I fully recharged with delicious dim sum during lunch! Look forward to my next restaurant exploration~ 😊

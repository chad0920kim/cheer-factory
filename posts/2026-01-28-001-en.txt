It's lunchtime! And like many 40-something office workers, I'm always figuring out where to eat. Today, I went to 'Dimdimsum' in Myeongdong, which is famous for its dim sum. Guess what? I got a 10% discount coupon! I couldn't miss this chance. I rushed over there! 😎

Thanks to the coupon, I ordered a bunch of dishes that I usually find a bit pricey. This is what I call a small splurge! 😆 The dim sum at Dimdimsum tastes almost exactly like the dim sum I had in Hong Kong, so it's perfect when I'm missing Hong Kong. The atmosphere is also clean and spacious, making it a comfortable place to eat lunch.

I ordered the Wonton Noodle Soup and Shrimp and Chives Dumplings! The broth of the Wonton Noodle Soup was really refreshing, and the noodles were so chewy that I slurped them right up. The Shrimp and Chives Dumplings were crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside – absolutely delicious! But be careful, freshly made dumplings are super hot. 🔥 I almost burned my mouth... 😅

The prices are a bit on the higher side, but with the 10% discount, it was much more affordable. If you want to eat dim sum in Myeongdong, I recommend Dimdimsum! Especially when you have a discount coupon. 🤩 It's near Myeongdong Station, so the location is great! I recharged with delicious dim sum during lunch! Look forward to my next restaurant adventure~ 😊

Tip: If you sign up for membership, you'll get a 10% coupon every month.

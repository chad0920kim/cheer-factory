As a 40-something office worker always thinking about where to go for lunch as soon as it's noon, that's me! Today, I went to 'Dimdimsum' in Myeongdong, which is famous for its dim sum. Guess what? I got a 10% discount coupon! I couldn't miss this opportunity, so I rushed over there. 😎

Thanks to the coupon, I ordered dishes that I usually found a bit pricey. This is what you call a small flex, right? 😆 Dimdimsum tastes almost exactly like the dim sum I had in Hong Kong, so it's a great place to go when I'm missing Hong Kong. The atmosphere is also clean and spacious, so you can eat comfortably during lunchtime.

I ordered Wonton Noodle Soup and Shrimp and Chives Dumplings! The broth in the Wonton Noodle Soup was so refreshing, and the noodles were chewy, so I slurped it all up. The Shrimp and Chives Dumplings were crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside – so delicious! But be careful because the freshly made dumplings are super hot. 🔥 I almost burned the roof of my mouth… 😅

The prices are a bit high, but with the 10% discount, it was much more affordable. I recommend Dimdimsum when you want to eat dim sum in Myeongdong! Especially go when you have a discount coupon. 🤩 It's located near Myeongdong Station, so the location is also great! I've recharged my happiness with delicious dim sum during lunchtime! Stay tuned for my next restaurant adventure~ 😊

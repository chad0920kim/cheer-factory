To be honest, I got teased a bit for doing "vibe coding." An old guy who's been just saying hi for over 10 years suddenly coding? Tsk tsk. 

But you know what? It's surprisingly fun. Nothing too fancy, but I'm writing scripts to automate Excel stuff and making simple web pages.

Things I never even imagined before are happening right in front of me. It's like a whole new world. Now I won't starve even after I retire... right? Maybe I'll make something and sell it. Hehe.

It's Dangerous Outside the Blanket, But I Still Gotta Go to Work

Winter mornings are the best inside the blanket, right? It's warm and cozy, like the perfect escape. 

My eyes feel heavy, and my brain's screaming 'Just five more minutes!', but my body already knows the cruel reality: I have to go to work. 

The moment I kick off the blanket, a freezing wind will slap my face... but what can I do? Gotta make a living.

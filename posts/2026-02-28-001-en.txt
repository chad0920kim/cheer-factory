Hi everyone, this is Kim Manager, a worker in Myeongdong!

What did you all have for lunch?
I accidentally found a seolleongtang (ox bone soup) place while passing by and decided to try it out.

It's called 'Shingawon', and it just had that feeling of a real hidden gem. 
You know how it is with good restaurants, right? Simple menu!
What was the origin of seolleongtang again...? I suddenly got curious.

Finally, the seolleongtang arrived!
The milky broth looks so rich, right?
As soon as I took a spoonful, the deep and savory flavor was the best.
The kimchi and radish kimchi were also super delicious!

I also ordered a king-sized dumpling, and it came with 5. 
It was so filling with lots of stuff inside!
It was even tastier when I dipped it in the seolleongtang broth.
Price as per menu.

When you're craving a hot soup in Myeongdong, Shingawon across the street is a good option.
It's good for eating alone, and you can fill up your stomach.
Today's lunch was also a success! See you in the next restaurant review!

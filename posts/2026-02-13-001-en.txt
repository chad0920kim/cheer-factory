Hi everyone, Myeongdong office workers! It's your 40s editor who's always looking forward to lunchtime.

Today, I finally went to this tteokbokki place that I've only heard rumors about!

The star of the day is this tteokbokki restaurant famous for its 'Garlic Gopchang Tteokbokki'. Just like many restaurants in Myeongdong, you need to pay first here.

Of course, the signature menu is Garlic Gopchang Tteokbokki!

The garlic aroma is seriously amazing. The gopchang (small intestine) is also chewy and goes so well with the tteokbokki sauce. The tteok (rice cake) is long, and it's fun to cut it yourself. You can even eat it whole if you want! I really loved the chewy texture of the tteok.

The price is a little high for tteokbokki, but I think it's worth it because it includes gopchang and the portion is pretty generous. The vibe is like a super hip tteokbokki place? It's perfect for chatting with friends while you eat.

If you're looking for a great tteokbokki place in Myeongdong, I totally recommend this place! You definitely have to try the Garlic Gopchang Tteokbokki. You won't regret it!

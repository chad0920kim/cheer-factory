The Significance of a Sunday Morning Coffee

There are those weekend mornings when you'd love to sleep in, but your body decides otherwise. After a bit of lazy lingering, you eventually head out for a cup of coffee. There's something quite enjoyable about watching the small groups of people gathered at the local cafe, each absorbed in their own little world.

It's a familiar scene, but it exudes a sense of calm that's absent during the weekday hustle. Taking a sip of warm coffee inexplicably makes my heart feel all soft and fuzzy.

Isn't this what they call simple happiness? It's just a mundane Sunday morning routine, but it gives me the strength to get through the week. It's not as thrilling as, say, vibe coding, but hey, this is what makes life worth living.

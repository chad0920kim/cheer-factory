Hey everyone! I've activated my Myeongdong office worker lunch 맛집 (delicious restaurant) radar! Today, I'm going to introduce you to a 고깃집 (Korean BBQ restaurant) that's the ultimate value for money. 

"10,000 won for 150g" - it's an unbelievable price, I know! 😎 Honestly, at first, I was skeptical, thinking, 'Since it's cheap, the quality must be bad, right?' But surprise! The taste was actually pretty good.

The owner grills the meat for you, and he's so meticulous about it. 🔥 Thanks to that, you get to eat it at the most delicious moment! Of course, considering the price, even the owner's nagging sounds delicious. 🤣

The atmosphere is just like a neighborhood Korean BBQ place! It's a great place to go when you want to have meat for lunch in a comfortable setting. It's located near Hapjeong, so check your map app for the details! If you want to eat your fill without breaking the bank, I highly recommend it. 👍

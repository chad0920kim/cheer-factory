Hey everyone, it's your Myeongdong office worker food explorer!

Today, I'm going to introduce one of my favorite snack bars. It's cozy like a small attic ('Darakbang' in Korean), but it's like a hidden gem.

The place is called... Darakbang... but actually, it's located in the basement. 😉 Can you believe you can get Kimchi Kalguksu for only ₩7,500 in the heart of Myeongdong? With today's prices, it's a super generous deal.

The Kimchi Kalguksu soup is spicy and refreshing, and the noodles are chewy and delicious. I think they even make their own kimchi! 👍 Although it's a snack bar, they also have curry rice, so it feels a bit like a Korean diner.

The curry rice might seem ordinary, but it's surprisingly addictive. It has that comforting taste like your mom's homemade curry. 😋 It's a great place for eating alone and perfect for a quick lunch.

If you're looking for an affordable and tasty snack bar in Myeongdong, you should definitely check it out! You won't regret it. 😊

A Cloudy Day

I woke up this morning to a cloudy sky.
Days like this make my heart feel heavy for no reason.

But when I think about it, don't we need cloudy days to appreciate sunny ones more?
Just like how difficult times make the good times feel more precious.

Today, I just keep going.
Tomorrow will be different.

Da Nang Nights: A Sip of Salty Solace

A glass of beer on Da Nang beach. The swaying palm tree shadows mirrored my own restless heart. I escaped here from the relentless grind back in Korea. It's not a perfect escape, but it's a magical moment that lets me forget the tangled reality, even just for a little while.

Let's put aside the backstabbing colleagues, the endless reports, the failed projects… Forget the bitter taste of reality, for now. I'll savor this cool beer and hope for a bitter-sweet, yet refreshing tomorrow. Well, tomorrow will probably be the same... but isn't it enough to be happy, even just for today?

It's no secret I came here to clear my head after wrestling with Vibecoding. Coding is just impossible without beer, after all. Maybe it's just my imagination, but the bugs I encounter in Da Nang seem a little less hateful.

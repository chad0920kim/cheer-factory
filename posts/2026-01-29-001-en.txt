Hi everyone! I'm a 40-something office worker in Myeongdong, always on the hunt for great lunch spots. 

Today, I'm introducing a place I've already visited twice this week! That means it's definitely perfect for my taste, right?

There's usually a little wait during lunchtime, but you can save time by deciding what to eat while looking at the menu! They have a variety of noodles and rice dishes, and the prices aren't too bad considering Myeongdong prices. Today, after thinking about what to eat, I decided to definitely order the Xiaolongbao, which I enjoyed last time! Oh, I was so focused on eating that I forgot to take pictures. ㅠㅠ It's already in my stomach, what can I do... I guess I'll have to eat it again next time.

Today, I ordered the roast duck rice bowl along with the Xiaolongbao. The glossy roast duck was piled high on top of the rice, and the visuals were perfect! The sweet and savory sauce and the tender roast duck were a fantastic combination. I scraped every last grain of rice clean.

There are many people eating alone today, and it's also good to come with colleagues and order several dishes to share. The clean atmosphere is also a plus, making it a comfortable place to eat during lunchtime! If you want to have a delicious lunch in Myeongdong, give it a try!

Lunchtime! Where should I go today? 🤔 I'm tired of eating the same food every day, so I decided to try the KEPCO cafeteria! 🤭 I've heard rumors that the food here is really good. And I found out that outsiders can eat here too! 😎

It's located on the first basement floor of the Korea Electric Power Corporation building. And guess what? There's a model of old Seoul in the lobby on the first floor! 😲 It was fun looking at the miniatures. (But the scale seems a little off... 🤣)

Okay, finally got my meal ticket! Only 6,000 won for sea tangle rice, soybean paste soup, seaweed, kimchi, salad, and flat meat patty! Isn't that awesome?! 👍 The sea tangle rice was chewy and delicious, and the soybean paste soup was perfect. The side dishes were also neat and good!💯

Honestly, I didn't expect much from a company cafeteria, but it was surprisingly spacious and clean. There were a lot of people eating alone, so I could enjoy my meal without feeling awkward. 😌 However, it gets super crowded during lunchtime! I recommend going before 12 o'clock! 🙏

In conclusion! This quality for 6,000 won is a total steal! I'll definitely come here often. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for an affordable lunch in Myeongdong! 🤗

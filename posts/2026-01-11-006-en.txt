Last night, I finally cracked open that tequila I'd been saving. To be honest, it was a bottle I'd been cherishing. I've been so caught up in vibe coding lately that I haven't taken my wife out on a proper date. Feeling guilty, I decided to take the plunge and open it. 

Sitting across from her, sipping our drinks after so long, I felt a pang of regret for the time I'd neglected her. Coding is great, but it's clear that the person beside me is the most important thing.

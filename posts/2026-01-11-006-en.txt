Last night, I finally opened that bottle of tequila I'd been saving. It's actually a liquor I've been really treasuring. I've been so caught up in vibecoding lately that I haven't been on a proper date with my wife. So, feeling apologetic, I decided to open it up with a heavy heart.

Sitting across from her, sipping our drinks, I couldn't help but reflect on all the time I'd neglected her. Coding is great, but the person by your side is definitely the most important thing. I'm going to start making things right from today.

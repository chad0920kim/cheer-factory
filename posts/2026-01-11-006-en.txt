Last night, I finally cracked open that bottle of tequila I'd been saving. Truth be told, it was a really special one. I've been so caught up in vibe coding lately that I haven't been on a proper date with my wife. So, feeling guilty, I took the plunge and opened it. 

Sitting across from her, sharing a drink after so long, I couldn't help but think about all the time I'd neglected. Coding is great, but I realized again that the person next to you is the most important thing.

Another overtime today, and another one tomorrow. I can almost hear the hamster wheel spinning! 

The problems are piling up, but I don't see any signs of them getting solved. I sometimes wonder if all this will ever be sorted out. 

I can't be the only one feeling like this, right? Everyone's probably going through similar struggles, I guess. 

Ugh, whatever. I'm just gonna go home and grab a beer.

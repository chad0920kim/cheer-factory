I'm really craving a Kozel Dark today.

A can of beer on the way home from work would be perfect.

But then I remembered I'm out of cinnamon powder.

I definitely need to buy some cinnamon powder tomorrow... I'm gonna sprinkle a lot on my Kozel Dark and enjoy it.

Anyone who knows this taste is probably in their late 40s like me, maybe.

The scent of cinnamon makes life's bitterness sweet, can't miss out on that. It's so good.

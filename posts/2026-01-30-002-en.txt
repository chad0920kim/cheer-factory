Lunch time, what should I eat today~ 🤔

I came to McDonald's after a really long time! 🍔🍟 It's so popular, maybe because it's a global food. McDonald's is always crowded everywhere, I guess.

Instead of the usual Coke and fries, I tried something different today! 🥤 I got coleslaw instead of fries, and an iced Americano instead of Coke. I kind of feel healthier? 😎

McDonald's, well, it tastes like what everyone knows! 👍 Sometimes I crave that familiar taste. It's cheap and easy to eat alone, so I come here often.

If you want a quick lunch in Myeongdong, McDonald's is a good choice. Especially try the coleslaw & iced Americano combo like me! You can experience a different McDonald's. 😉

I'll be back with another Myeongdong 맛집 (delicious restaurant) next time! 🙋‍♀️

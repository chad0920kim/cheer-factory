Hey everyone, my Myeongdong office worker lunch 맛집 (mat-jip - good eats) exploration is back! Today, I went to a place famous for their Ham Bomb Budae-jjigae (Korean army stew with ham and sausage).

Look at all that ham in the picture! This is for two people, and the ham is seriously substantial, right? I was also touched by how generously they included the rolled egg. And they give you a big bowl of rice. Seriously generous!

Honestly, a lot of budae-jjigae places use cheap ham, right? But you can tell right away here. It's not that typical cheap ham flavor. Because the ham itself is tasty, the soup also tastes deep and rich.

They had a few other lunch menu options besides budae-jjigae, but I highly recommend the budae-jjigae! I remember the price being pretty good too. Considering Myeongdong prices, it's a great value!

The atmosphere is just a normal restaurant. It's not super fancy or anything, but it's a good place to eat comfortably! If you want a hearty meal in Myeongdong, give this place a try. You won't regret it!

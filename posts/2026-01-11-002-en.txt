Starting My Second Act: A Dutch Coffee Business with My Daughter?

Planning to make and sell Dutch coffee with my daughter. A 50/50 profit split! Haha, perfectly fair. 

Raising her is already a lot of fun, but now she's my business partner too. It's incredibly moving. But... already getting bombarded with nagging: 'Dad, you gotta do marketing like this!'

Still, it's great. The small joy of brewing coffee with my daughter after work. Is this what they call work-life balance...?

(Scratching head) It'd be great if it works out, but if it doesn't, well, it'll be life experience, right?

Finally! Photo Upload Feature Added!

Oh my god, I can finally upload photos to my blog! Adding a feature to this ancient blog feels incredible. It's like switching from a 2G phone to a smartphone for the first time. 

Now I might upload some pictures of my commute home or some funny memes. Of course, absolutely no work-related photos allowed. I'm not trying to become a 'boomer' overnight.

It's a small change, but I'm ridiculously excited. Is it thanks to my 'vibe coding'? Whatever the reason, yesss!

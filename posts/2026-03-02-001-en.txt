Hey guys! I haven't posted about Myeongdong restaurants lately, have I? 😎 Today, I'm going to share my review of a dwaeji gukbap (pork rice soup) place near Haemi Eupseong Fortress. (Paid for it myself!) It's not in Myeongdong, but I highly recommend it! 👍

The place was called "Haemi Dwaeji Gukbap," and I liked that they used Korean pork. The price was pretty average considering current prices. About 10,000 won for a bowl of dwaeji gukbap.

They said it's Busan-style dwaeji gukbap, but honestly, I'm not from Busan, so I wouldn't know... I was a little surprised because the broth was clear. 😅 Isn't dwaeji gukbap usually oily? But when I tried it, it was clean and pretty good. The person in front of me ordered sundae gukbap (blood sausage rice soup), and it seemed like the broth was the same as the dwaeji gukbap, just with meat and sundae added. 🤔

The pork was really tender, which I loved! Adding a lot of jeongguji (chives) and spicy green peppers made the seasoning just right, and it took away any greasiness. Perfect! 😍 (FYI, I thought it was a little salty, but my mom added more salt. 😅 So, it depends on the person.)
They were nice enough to give me a broth refill, so I added some spicy sauce and finished a second bowl. 😋

The location is right in front of Haemi Eupseong Fortress after getting off Haemi IC on the Seohaean Expressway! It's perfect for taking a walk around the fortress after eating. 👍 I think it would be good for a date or a family outing! If you're going to Haemi, give it a try! 😉

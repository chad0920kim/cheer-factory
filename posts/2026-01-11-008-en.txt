I baked a frozen pizza, and wow, times have really changed. The quality is almost restaurant-level now. 

Getting an oven at home has really improved my quality of life. No need to order expensive pizzas anymore, I can just crack open a beer and enjoy some me-time. Isn't this the definition of simple joys?

Sometimes, a conveniently-made frozen pizza is more comforting than a perfect meal.

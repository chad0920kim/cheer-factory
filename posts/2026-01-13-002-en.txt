OpenAI used to be like, the icon of innovation, right? But these days, I'm definitely using ChatGPT less often.

I tried out Gemini and Claude, and they're pretty good. Especially Claude, it seems to have a real strength in writing.

Tech changes are always unpredictable, you know? But thanks to that, it's fun learning new tools.

I gotta do Vibe Coding and learn AI tools too. Late 40s and still got a lot to learn, haha.

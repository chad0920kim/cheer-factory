I just learned about something called a s'more today. Apparently, it's an American camping dessert. AI told me about it.

So, you roast a marshmallow and sandwich it between chocolate and crackers. It doesn't seem like much, but I bet it would taste amazing if you ate it while camping.

Finding out about new things is fun, and that's another small joy in life.
